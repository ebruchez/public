### 2024

- 2024-02-23: [Isaac Asimov - I, Asimov](https://www.amazon.com/I-Asimov-Memoir-Isaac/dp/055356997X)
    - 1994
    - language: English
    - rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: Asimov's memoir, which he wrote at the end of his life, knowing that he didn't have much longer to live. He wrote a good part on his hospital bed, before getting out of the hospital to get another year or so of good life. Asimov: prolific writer; science-fiction author, but also non-fiction writer; humanist; acrophobe; hated traveling and never flew; great speaker and teacher; great sense of humor; "busy" father; unhappy first marriage; happy second marriage; spent his time writing. Overall, he seems to have been a great man. The only low might be that he, at least during parts of his life, tended to flirt too much with young women (this is not really discussed in the book, although he alludes to young women a few times). 
- 2024-02-12: [Steve Wozniak - iWoz](https://www.amazon.com/iWoz-Computer-Invented-Personal-Co-Founded/dp/0393330435)
    - 2007
    - language: English
    - rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: This is not the definitive Wozniak book, just Woz setting some things straight. I didn't know a number of things, like his involvement in music festivals in the early 1980s, the Shoreline Amphitheater, the Discovery Museum, his vocation as a teacher (of computers), and more. There is a lot that is missing as well, including details of his relationship with Steve Jobs, but the book allows understanding Woz's mind a little.    
- 2024-01-30: [Isaac Asimov - The Caves of Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caves_of_Steel)
    - 1954
    - language: English
    - tags: #reread
    - NOTES: Like Pebble in the Sky, I read this book in the 1990s. Good story.

### 2023

- 2023-12-30: [Isaac Asimov - Pebble in the Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_in_the_Sky)
    - 1950
    - language: English
    - tags: #reread
    - NOTES: I read this book in the 1990s, but I had no recollection of the story. It is pretty good, fairly short read, which keeps you wanting to know more until the last pages.
- 2023-09-29: [John Christopher - Cloud on Silver](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Silver-John-Christopher/dp/0992768667)
    - 1964
    - language: English
    - rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: A fairly quick read of another book by the author of the Tripods. Some interesting ideas. The development of the characters is just ok: I found myself not really caring strongly about anyone in particular except maybe Yasha. However I strongly disliked the characters which the author no doubt intended the reader to dislike. The ending was a page-turner. It wasn't especially surprising, except maybe for one gruesome point.
- 2023-06-29: [Tracy Kidder - The Soul of a New Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine)
    - 1981
    - language: English
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: I really enjoyed this book.
- 2023-05-26: [Eric Schlaepfer and Windell H. Oskay -  Open Circuits](https://opencircuitsbook.com/)
    - 2023
    - language: English
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: This book is a coffee table book, but in a good way. I devoured the whole thing very quickly. Not only are the pictures stunning, as is the effort that went into the preparation of the circuits and their photography, but each picture comes with explanations that are both interesting and succinct. Thanks to this book I have gained great insights into electronic components and I am left with a sense of awe as well. 
- 2023-04-28: [Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess' Stardust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(Gaiman_novel))
    - 1999
    - language: English
    - rating: 5/5
- 2023-03: [Winston Churchill - The Second World War: Alone](https://www.amazon.com/The-Second-World-War-Alone-audiobook/dp/B0017W99D4/)
    - language: English
    - tags: #audiobook
    - Narrated by: Christian Rodska

### 2022

- 2022-11-17: [Émile Zola - Germinal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinal_(roman))
    - 1885
    - Language: French
    - tags: #reread #audiobook
    - NOTES:
        - I think I had read this a long, long time ago - probably more than 20 years ago.
        - This is a very dark novel. When you thought that you had seen enough drama, more comes: Maigrat's brains spilling and his mutilation; Alzire starving to death; soldiers killing innocent workers and children; child killing an innocent soldier; sabotage; Bonnemort strangling to death the young and beautiful Cécile; one horse, Trompette, dying of sadness at the bottom of the mine, and another, Bataille, dying of fear and drowning; men killed and terribly  burned by the "grisou"; ugly fight between men; killing of Chaval; rotting body of Chaval floating in the flooded mine and coming to Étienne and Catherine; death of Catherine by exhaustion and starvation.
        - Zola is very direct. Everything is said rather than hinted. Metaphors or images are explained. I think the text could have been a little better with some of that weight removed.
        - There are some positive, humane aspects: determination, forgiveness, love, courage, and the workers doing anything they can to save stranded miners.   
        - The darkest aspect is the fact that the novel ends like it started, but after death and more misery, and only a very faint and distant hope.
- 2022-10-18: [René Barjavel - La Nuit des temps](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Nuit_des_temps)
    - 1968
    - Language: French
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: I devoured this sci-fi novel. It's a good, simple story. I hadn't heard about René Barjavel before. I like the author's style: it is very direct and wastes no words. The story moves along at a very fast pace.
- 2022-10-02: [The Typewriter Legend](https://www.amazon.com/Typewriter-legend-Frank-ed-Masi/dp/0961438606)
    - 1985
    - Editor: Frank T. Masi
    - Author: Don Sutherland
    - Published by Panasonic/Matsushita Electric Corporation of America
    - NOTES: I bought this book without really knowing whether it would be good or not. While it is not very scholarly, it turned out to be a great book! There are 124 pages of text, as well as 62 pages of black and white illustrations in the middle. Most of the book is of great quality. I didn't find any glaring mistake or omission. What I liked is that the author regularly adds perspective to the content instead of being only descriptive. His style is very pleasant. I did find a couple of small mistakes here or there, but they are of very little consequence. The book says "Panasonic" on the cover page, and it appears to have been sponsored by that company. It's unknown whether the author wrote the content entirely under a contract with that company, or if only part of the content was added to fit the Panasonic mold. Because it's clear in a few parts of the text that the author was directed to cover "electronic typewriters" to some degree. I'd say that this, at the end of the book, is probably the weakest part. There is no real coverage of the history of electronic typewriters. Yet those started early, including a lot of work done at IBM, Xerox, Olivetti. But then, those would have been competitors of Panasonic so there is a hint of a conflict of interest there. Also, writing this in the early-to-mid 1980s, it might have been hard to find good information about that history. But this, again, is not very important as the rest of the book is excellent. We also learn, based on image captions, that Panasonic owned a typewriter collection.
- 2022-09-28: [Einstein: His Life and Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein:_His_Life_and_Universe)
    - 2007 
    - NOTES: A good biography without big surprises. Isaacson's takeaway is that Einstein was an anticonformist, and that drove much else in his life. I found Einstein's involvement with pacifism interesting, in particular how he partly grew out of it in the face of a changing world. I also found interesting his liking of the United States, and his taking the freedom he experienced in his new country to heart. 
- 2022-05: [Jack Vance - Rhialto the Marvellous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhialto_the_Marvellous)
    - 1984
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: This contains three stories. My favorite, and the longest, is "Fader's Waft", where Rhialto is sent back in time a few aeons to retrieve the Perciplex. Rhialto, as the main character, comes out as the most congenial of that band of magicians. Even Ildefonse, the "Preceptor", turns out to be keen to take what is not his, but he eventually turns out not too bad. I also loved the "peregrine palace", a sort of luxury spaceship, that takes the magicians to the end of the universe.
- 2022-05:  [Jack Vance - Cugel's Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cugel%27s_Saga)
    - 1983
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: Does Cugel actually settle down after this story ends? We'll never know. But the Saga is full of wonderful humor.
- 2022-04:  [Jack Vance - The eyes of the overworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eyes_of_the_Overworld)
    - 1966
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: Just a great story full of fun and interesting ideas and great humor.
- 2022-03-07: [Jack Vance - The Dying Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dying_Earth)
    - 1950
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: I remembered really enjoying reading these stores several years ago. I reread them with great pleasure too. The writing is just stunning, and the atmosphere unique. I particularly enjoyed the stories of Ulan Dhor and Guyal of Sfere.
- 2022-02-13: [Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn - The Gulag Archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulag_Archipelago)
    - 1973
    - tags: #audiobook
- 2022-02-07: [Benoît Mouchart - Michel Greg - dialogues sans bulles](https://www.amazon.com/Dialogues-sans-bulles-avec-Greg/dp/2205047868)
    - 1999
    - language: French
    - rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: Greg passed away the year this book was published (or, at least, copyrighted). Greg is one of my favorite bandes dessinées authors, mainly as the author of Achille Talon. I had been wanting to know more about him for a long time, and I finally bought this book. It is a large-format book, in the style of large-format bandes dessinées, with hardcover and glossy pages. It consists of chapters covering Greg's life and works, in an interview style. In addition, some of Greg's collaborators are also interviewed. There is a lot of information, but I am taking off a star because there could have been even more, and specifically I would have liked more on Achille Talon, which remained Greg's main and favorite series. This said, I appreciated learning about Greg's other series, as writer, and I plan to check some out (Bernard Prince, Comanche, Bruno Brazil, Olivier Rameau). I already knew (and own the complete editions of) the SF series Luc Orient. The consensus appears to be that it "aged badly", but I don't agree with this view I think there is a lot of appeal in Luc Orient: you just have to take it as the product of its time. I also learned more about Greg's stay in the US, at the behest of his publisher Dargaud. The goal of that stay was to promote French "comics" in the US, and that mostly failed, unfortunately.
- 2022-01-12: [Fred Vargas - Quand sort la recluse](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quand_sort_la_recluse)
    - 2017
    - tags: #audiobook
    - language: French
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: This is a "page turner", and the audiobook is also wonderfully read and acted. I'd like to read other books by the author, especially those with the character of "Jean-Bapt" ("Jean-Bat"?) Adamsberg. 

### 2021

- 2021-11-05: [Isaac Asimov - Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(Asimov_novel))
    - 1951
    - tags: #reread #audiobook
- 2021-12: [Notre-Dame de Paris - Neuf siècles d'histoire](https://www.amazon.com/Notre-Dame-Paris-Neuf-si%C3%A8cles-dhistoire/dp/2373951282)
    - 2019
    - tags: #paper
    - language: French
    - rating: 5/5
    - Authors: Dany Sandron, Andrew Tallon
    - NOTES: A quick but nice illustrated read about the Notre-Dame cathedral. Laser measurements of the building informed the illustrations which show the progress of and changes to the constructions across the years and centuries.
- 2021-10-15: [Alexandre Dumas - Les trois mousquetaires](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Trois_Mousquetaires)
    - 1844
    - rating: 5/5
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - language: French
    - NOTES: I read this a long time ago. It's a page-turner.
- 2021-09-29: [Barack Obama - A Promised Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Promised_Land)
    - 2020
    - tags: #audiobook
    - language: English
    - Narrated by: Barack Obama
    - NOTES: Shows Obama's intelligence and some extremely reflexive and introspective qualities. Reveals, or rather reinforces the knowledge that Obama and his team were operating in an extremely hostile environment with regard to the economic situation of the country when he took office, as well as politically when facing the Republicans.
- 2021-07: [Franz Kafka - Le Château](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_(novel))
    - language: French
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: I had read this book ("The Castle", "Das Schloß") probably 20+ if not 30+ years ago. This is one of Kafka's unfinished works. There is no doubt that it catches by its unique atmosphere. Reading comes with frustration as well, as there is no real conclusion. It appears that the work may never have been completed even if Kafka had lived, although we know of a possible conclusion to the story from Max Brod, Kafka's friend and literary executor. I enjoyed this reread, and I confess that I had forgotten almost all of my initial reading. My only memory was of a character down in a village and a castle above, and maybe a vague recollection of the aides! All the episodes, including with Frieda, Barnabas (Barnabé), the character of Klamm, Olga and Amalia, and others, I had completely forgotten. I love the atmosphere, absurdity, and ongoing rationalizations. It's a book you read first for the sake of immersing yourself in that atmosphere.
- 2021-07-29: [Stefan Zweig - Vingt-quatre heures de la vie d'une femme](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vingt-quatre_heures_de_la_vie_d%27une_femme)
    - 1927
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES:
        - I read this book many years ago.
        - Short book, really well written, at least in the French translation.
- 2021-06-27: [Albert Camus - L'étranger](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27%C3%89tranger)
    - 1942
    - tags: #reread #paper
    - language: French
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES:
        - I read this book many years ago.
        - It is written in an interesting, first-person style.
        - It is hard to fully sympathize with the narrator, given his insensitivity and indifference to almost everything, including his own fate.
        - But it is also interesting to contemplate the absurdity of his act and his condemnation. There is a criticism of the system here.
        - I had read this at least one a few decades ago, but I didn't remember much! This is not a happy book. But it is short and direct. The narrator, an anti-hero, does not "play the game" like the others. He is indifferent, including to his own life. Things happen just because they do. The short journey of his life described in the book is definitely, absurd: without purpose, without aim.
- 2021-03: [Robert Blickensderfer, Paul Robert - The Five-Pound Secretary](https://www.typewritermuseum.org/lib/library_bookshop_blick.html)
    - subtitle: An illustrated history of the Blickensderfer typewriter
    - 2003
    - language: English
    - tags: #paper
    - NOTES: A short but really informative and well-researched book about the Blickensderfer typewriter.
- 2021-03-xx: [Winston Churchill - The Second World War: Milestones to Disaster](https://www.amazon.com/Second-World-War-Milestones-Disaster/dp/B000XJNDO8)
    - language: English
    - tags: #audiobook
    - Narrated by: Christian Rodska
    - NOTES: Great writing and great narration. Looking forward to the next volumes. 
- 2021-02-20: [Bob Woodard - All the president's men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men)

### 2020

- 2020-10-29: [Marguerite Yourcenar - Mémoires d'Hadrien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_Hadrian)
    - 1951
    - tags: #audiobook
    - NOTES:
        - Really well written.
        - This is a pseudo-memoir, of course. In it, Hadrien narrates his life, ascension to power, rule, and finally near death.
        - During this course, Hadrien reflects about topics of love, politics, ruling, justic, travels, etc.
- 2020-10: [Thomas Payne - Common Sense]

     - TODO
- 2020-09-07: [Blaise Cendrars - L'or - La Merveilleuse Histoire du général Johann August Suter](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Or_(roman))
    - language: French
    - 1925
    - rating: 3/5
    - NOTES:
        - A short book. The writing style is interesting, dramatic, and fairly pleasant.
        - But the book feels rushed. Cendrars was in fact pressed to publish something at the time, and he did write *L'or* in something like a month and a half (based on previous research and knowledge).
        - I don't like that the book essentially tells the *myth* of Sutter. The book pictures a man that probably doesn't correspond much to reality. I am not only talking about some specific facts, like where or how he died, but about important aspects of this life. For this reason, I am tempted to read a more serious book about Sutter.
- 2020-09-22: [Mike Duncan - The storm before the storm](https://www.amazon.com/Storm-Before-Beginning-Roman-Republic/dp/1610397215)

    - NOTES:
        - Republic:
            - senate (since the first days)
            - tribunes (from "tribe") of the plebs: check on the senate (493 BC)
                - weakened at a later time, subservient to senate
            - fall/destruction of Carthage and Corinth: new provinces
            - Tiberius Gracchus and the Lex Agricola
            - Marius and Sulla: civil war
            - dictature of Sulla
                - proscriptions → terror
                - Caesar on the list, but eventually spared
            - Sulla was trying to restore the Republic, but it was just a last gasp

        - From Wikipedia: "the focus is on military rather than political events".
        - Book has illustrations, which I am not getting in the audiobook version. 
        - Cannons dragged from Fort Ticonderoga and brought to [Dorchester Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorchester_Heights), over Boston, caused the British, under Howe, to leave Boston.

            - Battle of Brooklyn (now known as battle of Long Island). Defeat.
            - "the largest battle ever fought in North America"
            - But retreat to Manhattan ordered by Washington is a big success.
            - Defeat of the Americans in Manhattan, except for a small victory at Harlem Heights.
            - New York fire, probably accidental.
            - Hanging of "spy".
            - Taking of Fort Washington on North of Manhattan. Big defeat: 59 Americans killed / 2,837 prisoners.
            - Washington has to leave New York and retreat to New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
        - Crossing of the Delaware
            - Night attach on Trenton, held by Hessians (German auxilaries)
            - Much needed victory of Washington. 
        - American troops
            - poorly equipped: no uniforms, some without shoes or weapons 
            - large desertions
            - expiring enlistments, but after Trenton victory, managed to reenlist troops

- 2020-02-10: [Walter Isaacson - Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/)
    - language: English
    - rating: 4/5
    - NOTES:
        - I started reading this in 2011, but for some reason got sidetracked.
        - I liked the first half the most, as that's where I learned the most too. In particular I didn't know much about the history and success of Pixar.
        - Like many I followed a lot of the events from 1997-2011 in real time, and so I knew a lot of that already.
        - I did find that there were too many repetitions in the second part and that a little bit more editing might have been good. The book remains well-written.
        - The parts treating of cancer and death are poignant.
        - All in all this gives a good picture of the personality, life, and achievements of Steve Jobs.
- 2020-01-25: [Voltaire - Candide](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/12873070-candide/1801897-erik)
    - tags: #ebook #reread
    - language: French
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: I read this book in high school, and maybe even once later. One benefit is that it's short. It is a satire, which makes you smile and cringe at the same time. It depicts a world that is utterly dystopian, except for the El Dorado episode which is a utopia, but an utterly unrealistic one. Besides the famous punchline "Il faut cultiver son jardin",  Voltaire manages to get a few words of wisdom along the way, such as "le travail éloigne de nous trois grands maux : l'ennui, le vice, et le besoin". Voltaire satirises, religion, philosophy, the rich, the poor - nobody escapes. Few of the characters in the book are virtuous, besides Candide and a few characters which end up joining him. But Candide is a very naive character.

    - Rating: 4/5
    - language: French
    - NOTES: A good story in an interesting atmosphere. The *voice* of the reader is great, but I found his *tone* often monotonous and casual, as if all characters were not involved if not contemptuous. He gets better toward the end of the story.

### 2019

- 2019-10-31: [Richard N. Current - The typewriter and the men who made it](https://www.worldcat.org/title/typewriter-and-the-men-who-made-it/oclc/1594574)
    - tags: #paper
    - Rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: What I learned:
        - James Densmore coined "type-writer" and "Caligraph"
        - Caligraph designed by Yost
        - Yost was quite the "reality distortion field" guy of his time
        - the system of companies, royalties, etc. got very complicated
        - Sholes diluted to 1/10, then nothing as of 1880 (probably)
        - Sholes needed money, James advised to keep shares, but Sholes needed/wanted out
        - Jame Densmore worked with his brothers, Emmett (physician) and Amos
        - they started selling in a []period of depression (1870s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Depression)
        - James Densmore coined "type-writer" and "Caligraph"
        - Amos and Emmett Densmore hired Franz X. Wagner, and they produced the Densmore machines (not James)
        - Sholes didn't believe much in his invention
        - Sholes fell out with James at some point, thought he got wronged; James didn't think so
        - patents: James delayed application in order to extend their validity; sometimes was really late
        - Sholes worked on his portable typewriter close to his death, really believed in it
        - Sholes signed some patents finally just a few days before his death
        - In the end, Sholes made about $40K total (about $1 million in 2019)
        - By 1882, Jame Densmore had probably made about the same as sholes
        - But later the Densmores made probalby 10x the amount of sholes (so ~$10 mio)

    - NOTES:
        - I read this book for the first time when it came out in French, around 1990.
        - This time I listened to the English version, narrated by Dion Graham, who often times gets very close to Miles's voice.

    - NOTES: I learned a lot from this book:
        - Armstrong was at the core into flying. He was an excellent test pilot. The best.
        - He ejected and parachuted in Korea when his plane's wing was cut by an anti-aircraft cable.
        - His house burned down and he saved his family.
        - Ed White, who died in the Apollo 1 fire, was his neighbor.
        - He flew Gemini 8 and managed to save his and David Scoot's lives by doing the right thing.
        - During a flight of the LLRV, he had to eject as well.
        - He was known for intelligence, thoughtfulness, and his ability as a pilot.

    - NOTES: A great story with memorable characters and an enticing historical context. The author has an interesting style and likes to recapitulate events so you never get lost. If you read it in a single shot that might be annoying, but if you read over a long period of time, that's actually a pretty good thing. I later watched the TV series, which is pretty good too.

    - tags: #ebook
    - 1982
    - NOTES: This is a quite good biography of [Herman Hollerith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith) (1860-1929), an inventor I had never heard about. He pioneered the use of punched cards for use in data processing, specifically compiling statistics. He was successful applying his "tabulating machines" to help with the US census and later other census. Later his machines were applied to so-called commercial usages. He formed the Tabulating Machine Company, which ultimately was consolidated in [The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company#The_Tabulating_Machine_Company), which became IBM. He was a peculiar if not a little eccentric character, probably like many inventors of the time. I found it interesting that so many concerns are very modern: engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, forming companies, keeping or losing control, and more. I regret that the book lacks detailed explorations of the machines themselves.

    - tags: #reread? #paper #french
    - I really enjoyed this tome, even though it is about 900 pages.
    - I have been stunned a few times by the way Victor Hugo writes. The man knew his craft.
    - The book is an interesting mix of action and a painting of French (and behond) society from before the French revolution (1789) to the time of Hugo's writing.

        - I cannot say that this book is a masterpiece, but given the circumstances of its writing (Pausch knew he was going to die very soon) it is an achievement.
        - Pausch appeared superhuman in his talk, but the book makes it clearer that it wast not that easy to go through those last few months.

	- I read this in French under the title "Les Hauts de Hurlevent". I could have read the original English but just felt like I wanted to read something in French!
	- I think I read this first in the summer of 1992, in French as well.
	- I liked it a lot for its atmosphere and the characters are unforgettable. As the book progresses you just want to know what will happen to Heathcliff in the end. It is all about individual feelings and passions, so definitely a [*Romantic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) work.
	- I also started reading the [graphic novel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907127119), which seems extremely well done, but would benefit from publication in a larger format.

    - Not as good as "Vingt mille lieues sous les mers", but it's a fairly quick read.
    - This book is mostly about the idea of using a balloon to cross Africa from East to West. The technical aspects are interesting, and handled realistically, except maybe for the source of electricity: while the balloon's hydrogen does leak, the fact that the battery might lose charge is never mentioned AFAICT.

    - Started reading probably in January 2014, then let it rest.
    - This is the weakest of the Odyssey series. The most interesting part is the appendix, where Clarke comments about some historical bits, where some ideas came from, and even how some of the ideas in the book were already obsolete.
