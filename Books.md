# Books

I don't have much time to read so I try to read books I know are excellent. I have also found myself re-reading several books which I really enjoyed in the past.

## Books I plan to read in 2020

- TODO

## Rating scale

- 5/5: just great
- 4/5: very good but with some flaws
- 3/5: average
- 2/5: not good but with some redeeming qualities
- 1/5: just bad

I don't plan to read any books with 1/5, 2/5, or even 3/5 rating, but I can't rule out I might be disappointed by a reading.

## Candidate books I would like to read next

## Books I have read

Dates are completion dates.

### 2021

- 2021-06-27: [Albert Camus - L'étranger](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27%C3%89tranger)
    - 1942
    - tags: #ebook #reread
    - NOTES:
        - I read this book many years ago.
        - It is written in an intersting, first-person style.
        - It is hard to fully sympathize with the narrator, given his insensitivity and indifference to almost everything, including his own fate.
        - But it is also interesting to contemplate the absurdity of his act and his condemnation. There is a criticism of the system here.

### 2020

- 2020-10-29: [Marguerite Yourcenar - Mémoires d'Hadrien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_Hadrian)
    - 1951
    - NOTES:
        - Really well written.
        - This is a pseudo-memoir, of course. In it, Hadrien narrates his life, ascension to power, rule, and finally near death.
        - During this course, Hadrien reflects about topics of love, politics, ruling, justic, travels, etc. 
- 2020-09-07: [Blaise Cendrars - L'or - La Merveilleuse Histoire du général Johann August Suter](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Or_(roman))
    - language: French
    - 1925
    - rating: 3/5
    - NOTES:
        - A short book. The written style is interesting, dramatic, and fairly pleasant.
        - But the book feels a little rushed. Cendrars was in fact pressed to publish something at the time, and he did write *L'or* in something like a month and a half (based on previous research and knowledge).
        - Also I don't like that the book essentially tells the *myth* of Sutter. The book pictures a man that probably doesn't correspond much to reality. I am not only talking about some specific facts, like where or how he died, but about important aspects of this life. For this reason, I am tempted to read a more serious book about Sutter.
- 2020-09-22: [Mike Duncan - The storm before the storm](https://www.amazon.com/Storm-Before-Beginning-Roman-Republic/dp/1610397215)
    - language: English
    - 2017
    - tags: #audiobook
    - NOTES:
        - Republic:
            - senate (since the first days)
            - tribunes (from "tribe") of the plebs: check on the senate (493 BC)
                - weakened at a later time, subservient to senate
            - fall/destruction of Carthage and Corinth: new provinces
            - Tiberius Gracchus and the Lex Agricola
            - Marius and Sulla: civil war
            - dictature of Sulla
                - proscriptions → terror
                - Caesar on the list, but eventually spared
            - Sulla was trying to restore the Republic, but it was just a last gasp  
- 2020-08-13: [David McCullough - 1776](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1776_(book))
    - language: English
    - 2005
    - tags: #audiobook
    - NOTES:
        - From Wikipedia: "the focus is on military rather than political events".

            - Defeat of the Americans in Manhattan, except for a small victory at Harlem Heights.
            - New York fire, probably accidental.
            - Hanging of "spy".
            - Taking of Fort Washington on North of Manhattan. Big defeat: 59 Americans killed / 2,837 prisoners.

        - Crossing of the Delaware
            - Night attach on Trenton, held by Hessians (German auxilaries)
            - Much needed victory of Washington. 
        - American troops
            - poorly equipped: no uniforms, some without shoes or weapons 
            - large desertions
            - expiring enlistments, but after Trenton victory, managed to reenlist troops

- 2020-02-10: [Walter Isaacson - Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/)
    - language: English
    - rating: 4/5
    - NOTES:
        - I started reading this in 2011, but for some reason got sidetracked.
        - I liked the first half the most, as that's where I learned the most too. In particular I didn't know much about the history and success of Pixar.
        - Like many I followed a lot of the events from 1997-2011 in real time, and so I knew a lot of that already.
        - I did find that there were too many repetitions in the second part and that a little bit more editing might have been good. The book remains well-written.
        - The parts treating of cancer and death are poignant.
        - All in all this gives a good picture of the personality, life, and achievements of Steve Jobs.
- 2020-01-25: [Voltaire - Candide](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/12873070-candide/1801897-erik)
    - tags: #ebook #reread
    - language: French
    - rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: I read this book in high school, and maybe even once later. One benefit is that it's short. It is a satire, which makes you smile and cringe at the same time. It depicts a world that is utterly dystopian, except for the El Dorado episode which is a utopia, but an utterly unrealistic one. Besides the famous punchline "Il faut cultiver son jardin",  Voltaire manages to get a few words of wisdom along the way, such as "le travail éloigne de nous trois grands maux : l'ennui, le vice, et le besoin". Voltaire satirises, religion, philosophy, the rich, the poor - nobody escapes. Few of the characters in the book are virtuous, besides Candide and a few characters which end up joining him. But Candide is a very naive character.
- 2020-01-15: [Georges Simenon - L'affaire Saint-Fiacre](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Affaire_Saint-Fiacre)
    - tags: #audiobook
    - Rating: 4/5
    - language: French
    - NOTES: A good story in an interesting atmosphere. The *voice* of the reader is great, but I found his *tone* often monotonous and casual, as if all characters were not involved if not contemptuous. He gets better toward the end of the story.
- 2020-01-07: [Arthur Conan Doyle - The Complete Sherlock Holmes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40523972-the-complete-sherlock-holmes)
    - Rating: 5/5
    - tags: #ebook
    - NOTES: Classic. I started reading this in August 2018 and read casually.

### 2019

- 2019-10-31: [Richard N. Current - The typewriter and the men who made it](https://www.worldcat.org/title/typewriter-and-the-men-who-made-it/oclc/1594574)
    - tags: #paper
    - Rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: What I learned:
        - James Densmore coined "type-writer" and "Caligraph"
        - Caligraph designed by Yost
        - Yost was quite the "reality distortion field" guy of his time
        - the system of companies, royalties, etc. got very complicated
        - Sholes diluted to 1/10, then nothing as of 1880 (probably)
        - Sholes needed money, James advised to keep shares, but Sholes needed/wanted out
        - Jame Densmore worked with his brothers, Emmett (physician) and Amos
        - they started selling in a []period of depression (1870s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Depression)
        - James Densmore coined "type-writer" and "Caligraph"
        - Amos and Emmett Densmore hired Franz X. Wagner, and they produced the Densmore machines (not James)
        - Sholes didn't believe much in his invention
        - Sholes fell out with James at some point, thought he got wronged; James didn't think so
        - patents: James delayed application in order to extend their validity; sometimes was really late
        - Sholes worked on his portable typewriter close to his death, really believed in it
        - Sholes signed some patents finally just a few days before his death
        - In the end, Sholes made about $40K total (about $1 million in 2019)
        - By 1882, Jame Densmore had probably made about the same as sholes
        - But later the Densmores made probalby 10x the amount of sholes (so ~$10 mio)
- 2019-09-2x: [Miles - The Autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/Miles-Autobiography-Davis/dp/0671725823)
    - tags: #audiobook #reread
    - Rating: 5/5
    - NOTES:
        - I read this book for the first time when it came out in French, around 1990.
        - This time I listened to the English version, narrated by Dion Graham, who often times gets very close to Miles's voice.
- 2019-09-10: [Kafka - The Metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis)
    - tags: #ebook
    - Rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: Novella ("longer than a short story but shorter than a novel"). Read following [VBW's *A Bug's Life (Kafka's "The Metamorphosis"*)](https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/169)
- 2019-09: [Jay Barbree - Neil Armstrong: A life of flight](https://www.amazon.com/Neil-Armstrong-Flight-Jay-Barbree-ebook/dp/B00HP1JZH6)
    - tags: #audiobook
    - NOTES: I learned a lot from this book:
        - Armstrong was at the core into flying. He was an excellent test pilot. The best.
        - He ejected and parachuted in Korea when his plane's wing was cut by an anti-aircraft cable.
        - His house burned down and he saved his family.
        - Ed White, who died in the Apollo 1 fire, was his neighbor.
        - He flew Gemini 8 and managed to save his and David Scoot's lives by doing the right thing.
        - During a flight of the LLRV, he had to eject as well.
        - He was known for intelligence, thoughtfulness, and his ability as a pilot.
- 2019-08-15: [Neal Stephenson - Atmosphæra Incognita]()
    - tags: #ebook
    - Rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: Short story with lots of good ideas.
- 2019-08-07: [Yuval Noah Harari - 21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari-ebook/dp/B079WM7KLS/)

- 2019-05-17: [Ken Follett - The Pillars of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth)
    - tags: #audiobook
    - Rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: A great story with memorable characters and an enticing historical context. The author has an interesting style and likes to recapitulate events so you never get lost. If you read it in a single shot that might be annoying, but if you read over a long period of time, that's actually a pretty good thing. I later watched the TV series, which is pretty good too.
- 2019-04-09: [Arthur Conan Doyle - The Adventure of the Dancing Men]
    - tags: #ebook
    - NOTES: Sherlock Holmes story.
- 2019-04-09: [Walter Isaacson - Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.amazon.com/Leonardo-Vinci-Walter-Isaacson-ebook/dp/B071Y385Q1/)
    - tags: #ebook
    - Rating: 5/5
    - NOTES: I learned a lot from this book and it was a very pleasant read.
- 2019-04: [Lawrence Krauss -  A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing](https://www.amazon.com/Universe-Nothing-There-Something-Rather-ebook/dp/B004T4KQJS)
    - tags: #audiobook

### 2018

- 2018-12-25: [Geoffrey D. Austrian - Herman Hollerith - Forgotten giant of information processing](https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Hollerith-Forgotten-Information-Processing-ebook/dp/B01NBDYN91)
    - tags: #ebook
    - 1982
    - NOTES: This is a quite good biography of [Herman Hollerith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith) (1860-1929), an inventor I had never heard about. He pioneered the use of punched cards for use in data processing, specifically compiling statistics. He was successful applying his "tabulating machines" to help with the US census and later other census. Later his machines were applied to so-called commercial usages. He formed the Tabulating Machine Company, which ultimately was consolidated in [The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company#The_Tabulating_Machine_Company), which became IBM. He was a peculiar if not a little eccentric character, probably like many inventors of the time. I found it interesting that so many concerns are very modern: engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, forming companies, keeping or losing control, and more. I regret that the book lacks detailed explorations of the machines themselves.
- 2018-08-15: [Arthur Conan Doyle - The Sign of the Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sign_of_the_Four)

    - tags: #ebook
    - I devoured this book. It moves fast and introduces interesting ideas on a background loaded with the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The
      translation by Ken Liu is very smooth.
- 2018-07: [Deborah Reber - Differently Wired: Raising an Exceptional Child in a Conventional World](https://www.amazon.com/Differently-Wired-Raising-Exceptional-Conventional/dp/1523502126)

    - This is really a very well made book. It features wonderful photographs, but also a lot of in-depth information about the history of

    - 1954
    - An account of the typewriter from its multiple inventors to the modern typewriter factory, including discussion of sales, typists, and more. Some
      interesting tidbits about how the Remington 1 came to be.

### 2017

- 2017-07-19: [Yuval Noah Harari - Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117/)

- 2017-07-21: Victor Hugo - Les misérables, Tome I
    - tags: #reread? #paper #french
    - I really enjoyed this tome, even though it is about 900 pages.
    - I have been stunned a few times by the way Victor Hugo writes. The man knew his craft.
    - The book is an interesting mix of action and a painting of French (and behond) society from before the French revolution (1789) to the time of Hugo's writing.
- 2017-02-11: [Randy Pausch - The Last Lecture](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Lecture-Randy-Pausch/dp/1401323251/)
    - 2008
    - tags: #paper
    - notes:
        - I had meant to read this since I saws Pausch's talks.
        - I cannot say that this book is a masterpiece, but given the circumstances of its writing (Pausch knew he was going to die very soon) it is an achievement.
        - Pausch appeared superhuman in his talk, but the book makes it clearer that it wast not that easy to go through those last few months.

- 2016-03-30: [Umberto Eco - Le nom de la rose (1980)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Nom_de_la_rose_(roman)) #reread #ebook #french
    - One of my favorite books, period!

- 2016-02-16: [Arthur C. Clarke - Rendezvous with Rama (1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama) #reread #ebook
    - One of the best science fiction stories ever written.
    - [highlights](Reading/2016-02-16%20-%20Rendezvous%20with%20Rama%20(Arthur%20C.%20Clarke).md)
- 2016-01-09: [Emily Brontë - Wuthering Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights) #reread #ebook #french
	- I read this in French under the title "Les Hauts de Hurlevent". I could have read the original English but just felt like I wanted to read something in French!
	- I think I read this first in the summer of 1992, in French as well.
	- I liked it a lot for its atmosphere and the characters are unforgettable. As the book progresses you just want to know what will happen to Heathcliff in the end. It is all about individual feelings and passions, so definitely a [*Romantic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) work.
	- I also started reading the [graphic novel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907127119), which seems extremely well done, but would benefit from publication in a larger format.

### 2015

- 2015-11-29: [Dan Simmons - The Fall of Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Hyperion_(novel)) #reread #ebook

- 2015-03-10: [Jules Verne - Cinq semaines en ballon](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinq_semaines_en_ballon) #ebook #gutenberg
    - Not as good as "Vingt mille lieues sous les mers", but it's a fairly quick read.
    - This book is mostly about the idea of using a balloon to cross Africa from East to West. The technical aspects are interesting, and handled realistically, except maybe for the source of electricity: while the balloon's hydrogen does leak, the fact that the battery might lose charge is never mentioned AFAICT.
- 2015-03-09: [T. Jack Foster Jr. - The Development of Foster City](http://www.amazon.com/Development-Foster-City-Jr-Jack-ebook/dp/B00CY1LR00/) #ebook
    - This is a short book.
    - Contains some interesting bits, although more depths would have been good.

- 2015-01-28: [Bright from the Start](http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Start-Science-Backed-Developing-Mindfrom-ebook/dp/B000UCUX46/) #ebook
    - Not that much content in this book. I skimmed very quickly through the second half.
    - I had bought this in August 2010 and probably started reading soon afterwards, but let it rest for a long time.

    - Started reading probably in January 2014, then let it rest.
    - This is the weakest of the Odyssey series. The most interesting part is the appendix, where Clarke comments about some historical bits, where some ideas came from, and even how some of the ideas in the book were already obsolete.

- 2013-08-29: Stefan Zweig - Le joueur d'échecs (Schachnovelle) #reread #audiobook
    - I first read this short book in high school in 1991 for German class (I probably read it in French!). I really liked it and developed interest in Zweig. In the years that followed I read several more of his books.
    - This time I listened to it as an audiobook during commute. It is simply a masterpiece of storytelling.
