About a month and a half ago, at the end of September, I [wrote](http://blog.bruchez.name/2013/09/gtd-review-buddies.html) about setting up a "GTD review buddy system" with [Alex](https://twitter.com/avernet). I can report that it went pretty well:

- Alex and I did 7 GTD review sessions, always on Monday at approximately 10 pm.
- In my case, each review session lasted at least 30 minutes, and sometimes close to an hour. Yes, I have really a big backlog to process!
- Yesterday, for the first time in maybe years, I managed to get down to zero items in my [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) inbox, and to only about 20 items in my e-mail inbox, consisting mainly of really old items that I still need to sort through. ["Inbox zero"](http://inboxzero.com/) is near!
- I have made good progress on reviewing and organizing my work-related projects. I am maybe about 3/4 through.

I still need to review all my personal projects, a task that I haven't started yet. I may or may not manage to be done reviewing all my project by the end of this year, but at this rate I should be pretty close. If everything goes well, I will be done catching up in early 2014, and then start doing regular GTD reviews, which should be much shorter.
